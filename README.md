## Python Projects
Projects I have worked on both for and outside of school using the Python language.

### Trip Advisor

This program calculates the cost of a trip given the cost of gas, food, hotels, etc. and the time it will take to complete the trip. More specifically, it uses the average speed and the distance traveled along with the vehicles mpg to make these calculations. In addition to this, it uses information on two different vehicles to tell you which one would be cheaper to take on your trip. Lastly, the program includes test cases for each of the functions used to ensure that they were programmed correctly. This program uses a combination of functions, if statements, and conversions between units. From completing this, I learned how to effectively convert, use, and return several different types of data so that they can be properly compared and analyzed.
